Cucumber Technologies:
What is Gherkin?
It is a Business Readable , Domain Specific Language that lets you describe software's behaviour
Example:Pop up message is displayed when buttons are clicked and errors are gone
Devloper:Pop up message is displayed and errors are gone on button clicked
QA- Pop up message is displayed - only when buttons are clicked and errors are gone


Keywords in Cucumber: Scenario,Feature,Feature File,Scenario outline , Step Definition

Scenario :
In Cucumber Testcases are represnted as Scenarios
Scenario contain Steps which are equivalent to test steps and use the following keywords(Gherkin syntax) to denote them: Given,When,Then,But,and And (case sensitive).
>Given:preconditions are mentioned in the Given Keyword
>When: The purpose of When steps is to describe the user action
>Then: The Purpose of Then Steps is to observe the expected output. The observations should be related to business value/ benefit of your Feature description.

When we specify a business requirement, sometimes there are mutiple pre-conditions,user actions, and expected outcomes

we are going to add one more scenario and will use the And and But keywords:
>And: This is  used for statements that are addition to the previous steps and represent positive statements
>But: This is used for staments that are in addition to previous steps and represent negative statements 


Scenario: Make Minimum Due Payment
>Given user is on Pay Credit page
>When user fills all details and select Minimum amount option
>And User clicks on Pay button
Then Credit Card confirmation page is displayed
And if reference number is displayed
But error message is displayed

When we specify a business requirement, sometimes there are multpile pre-conditons,user actions and expected outcomes

Feature and Feature File:
Feature represents Business requirement
Feature File acts as a Test which consist of all Scenarios

In Cucumber,Feature file contains Scenarios. We can simply create feature file with .feature extension
Scenarios belonging to specific area of application will be grouped into one Feature file

Feature file should contain either Scenario oe Scenario outline. The naming conventions for Feature file should be lowercase with feature extension

Feature: Credit Card payment
Scenario: Make Minmum payment
Given: User is on pay credit page
Then user fills details and select Minimum amount option

And User clicks on pay button
Then Credit Card confirmation page is displayed
